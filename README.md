# Course Feedback System

A web-based (live) Course Feedback System designed for university courses with a twist. This project aims to simplify the feedback loop between students and lecturers using QR codes and real-time analytics.

## Project Overview
The goal is to create an application where students can easily provide anonymous feedback for specific sessions, while professors can track engagement and satisfaction week-over-week without complex setup.

## Features

### For Students
* **Easy Access:** Join a session instantly by scanning a QR Code.
* **Anonymous Feedback:** Provide session-specific feedback safely and honestly.
* **History:** View an overview of participated sessions and anonymous group feedback results.

### For Professors & Lecturers
* **Quick Setup:** Create courses and weekly sessions with minimal effort.
* **Live Dashboard:** See feedback indicators and question voting in real-time during the lecture.
* **QR Generation:** Automatically generate QR codes for students to join.
* **Analytics:** Track week-to-week changes in ratings and get a summary after each session closes.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend/Database:** CouchDB
* **Methodology:** WizardOfOz (for prototyping/simulation)
